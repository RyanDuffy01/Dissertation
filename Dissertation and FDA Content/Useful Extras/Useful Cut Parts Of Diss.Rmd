These age standardized death rates are calculated using the using the equation given in Equation \@ref(eq:ESP)

\begin{equation}
  Age \; Standardized \; Rate = \frac{\sum_{k}P_km_k}{\sum_{k}P_k}
  (\#eq:ESP)
\end{equation}

where $P_k$ is the standard population in age group $k$ and $m_k$ is the observed mortality rate (deaths per 100,000 persons) in age group $k$. This standard population is hypothetical.
